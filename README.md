## Testing in Java

In Project1, I test a variant called Highlif of Conway's Game of life, that is imperfectly programmed.

The type of testing used is unit testing.

The tests are made with JUnit.

In Project2 I create a vector library and two levels of abstraction: Vectors and Fractions. 

The types of testing used are property and unit testing.

The tests are made with JUnit, specifically JUnit-QuickCheck.
